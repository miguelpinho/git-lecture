## Notes

"
Version control has become an indispensable tool in modern software
development. Version control systems allow you to keep track of your software
at the source level. You can track changes, revert to previous stages, and
branch off from the base code to create alternative versions of files and
directories.

One of the most popular version control systems is git. Many projects maintain
their files in a Git repository, and sites like GitHub and Bitbucket have made
sharing and contributing to code with Git easier than ever.
